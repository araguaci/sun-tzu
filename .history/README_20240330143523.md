> "O amor é quando o bem do outro é tão importante para nós que é mais valioso do que a nossa própria vida. É muito simples! É a definição que Jesus deu. É você, se preciso, morrer pela pessoa que você ama. Mas, veja: o importante não está no morrer, não é esse o ponto. O importante é pelo quê você morreu.
> 
> Santo Tomás de Aquino dizia que o amor é o desejo de eternidade do ser amado. Quer dizer, você quer que aquela pessoa dure para sempre, que ela não seja extinta. Então, para conservá-la eternamente, você até morre. Você perde esta vida para que a outra ganhe a vida eterna.
> O importante não é você morrer, mas o que ela vai ganhar com a sua morte – que é a vida imortal".

## Quick deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)][deploy]

- Click the Deploy button to copy this project to your own GitHub or GitLab account and deploy your podcast with Netlify in minutes. ✨

- Once you’ve got the project set up, you do need to
[activate Netlify Identity in the Netlify UI][identity], the
[“Git Gateway”][gateway] to allow e-mail/password authentication and you are ready to go.

---

## Deployment Services

Astropod is build in the top of [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and is ready to be deployed in the deployments services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare, AWS and much more.

The configuration for the deployment varies depending on the platform where you are going to do it. See the [official Astro information](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy your website.

## File storage

Astropod is designed to work with any file storage solution.

You can host your podcast files in your own code base inside the folder `public/audio` and this will automatically work with [git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) but free plans in GitHub and GitLab for LFS are limited so take that in mind.

You can also host your podcast files in any other cloud storage solution like DropBox, Google Drive, Cloudinary or on your own server. Once you upload your audio file you just need to copy the public URL of the audio file into your episode `AudioUrl` field.

For free unlimited cloud file storage we recommend use [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

## Content Management System

Astropod is designed in such a way that you can use it directly from the source code by editing the configuration files found in the `/.astropod` folder and modifying the episode markdown files contained in the folder `/src/content/episode`.

In order to manage podcast in a simpler way, astropod is configured by default with the CMS Serverless [Decap](https://decapcms.org/) which allows collaborative work, authentication with email or other providers and simple management.

For the easiest use of Decap we recommend deploying Astropod on Netlify since the authentication system is integrated into the platform and is configured natively. If you would like to facilitate your own OAuth authentication rather than use Netlify's service or a client side flow like implicit or PKCE, you can use one of this [community-maintained projects](https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/).

The fact that Astropod comes configured by default with Decap does not mean that it is the only CMS with which it can work, if you prefer to use another CMS like Sanity, Wordpress, Strapi, Tina, or any other you can follow [Astro's integration guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/) to your integrate your favorite CMS.
